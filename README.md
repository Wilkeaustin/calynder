This is my first big personal project. The general idea is that a user can come to the site and set reminders with a specific description and date/time and that reminder will be texted to their phone at the specified time. The initial build, for simplicities sake, will only allow you to make one reminder at a time, but as I continue to work on it I will eventually add profiles so that individuals can save reminders and reuse them as needed.
